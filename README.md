# xcom2-random-weapon-name-button
An XCOM 2 mod that adds the eponymous button to the Weapon Mod screen.

It's not at this time compatible with Grimy's Loot Mod, but a lot of
people have requested that, so I'm experimenting with ways to make that
happen. (Hence, I'm including this with its siblings on github so I
can feel more confident it will survive my hamfisted shenanigans.)
