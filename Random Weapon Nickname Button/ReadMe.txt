Did you know that the game actually has code that generates random nicknames for weapons? Well, I attached a button to it.

This adds a single button to the top left of the Armory's weapon mod UI. I've never actually seen a weapon get a name in the game without my intervention before, but this code seems to work; if they left it out for a reason, maybe we'll all find out as we click this...but it seems to work for me!!

Enjoy!
